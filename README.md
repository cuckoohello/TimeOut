# TimeOut for macOS

A native macOS break reminder app built with SwiftUI, inspired by the classic Time Out app. It helps you prevent eye strain and fatigue by reminding you to take regular breaks.

## Features
- **Flexible Break Types**: Supports "Micro" breaks (short, frequent) and "Normal" breaks (long, infrequent).
- **Full Screen Overlay**: Gently dims your screen to encourage you to step away.
- **Smart Idle Detection**: Automatically resets timers if you leave your computer naturally, avoiding unnecessary interruptions.
- **Customizable**: Configure durations and intervals to suit your workflow.
- **Menu Bar Control**: Quick access to pause, resume, or skip breaks.
- **Launch at Login**: Option to auto-start the app when you log in.

## How to Run
Requirements: macOS 14.0+ (Sonoma) or newer, Xcode / Swift 5.9+.

```bash
swift run
```

or open the folder in Xcode and press Run.
